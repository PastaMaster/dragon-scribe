# Dragon Scribe
A cross-platform design and formatting tool for player handouts and other small documents used in tabletop role-playing games.

## Features
- Documents are stored as text files (details TBD) to ensure their longevity and minimise their storage footprint.
- Documents can be rendered into PDF (details TBD) for printing and digital use.
- The user interface is built with [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) to be responsive, modern, and portable.
- The collection manager keeps documents organised without cluttering the file system.

## Usage
This project is currently in early development and not ready for general use. This section will be updated when core features have been implemented.
